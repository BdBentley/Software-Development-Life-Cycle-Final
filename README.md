Final review questions:

    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
    Interpreting user needs can seem to be a daunting task, however using the agile methodology we can address the customers needs.
    These methodologies are customer centric, they have a point of contact (Product Owner) who is in constant communication with 
    the customers at the end of the day and creating user stories. The Product owner themselves being in constant contact with the 
    scrum development teams ensures that if you follow the Agile process, you will be able to implement the users needs into a program. 
    Interpreting what the customer is actually saying can be difficult, but by being able to have continous development and allow 
    the customer in on that process you will get their constant feedback during reviews leaving no room for interpretation.
    
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    
    I approach programming through an agile based approach at work and at home. Most of my projects are relatively small and I 
    myself am the only person developing them. Being on scrum teams now I hope to continue to work on these projects and further 
    develop my experience as a developer on these teams. I would say it takes someone willing to contribute and communicate that 
    makes a good team member in software development. The technical skills can be taught, being personable typically cannot. The 
    ability to be a good team member truly relies on being a team player.
